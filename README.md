PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
This is my first static website that I built for my first year assignment in computer science where I received 76% for it. Both the code and the report has been added to this repository.

The goal of the webiste was for me to learn more about HTML5 and CSS3. No bootstrap was used in the creation of the website which allowed me to really get a better understanding of how CSS works. The website revolves around me where I talk about myself and give intresting facts about myself.

Feel free to have a look around and contact me, leave comments or issue requests with things I could have done better - I'm all about learning how to write better code.

P.S - There is no index.html in this website. I learnt about it after making this webiste so my version of index.html is home.html.
