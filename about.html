			</header>
			<h3>Who am I&#58;</h3>
			<p>My name is Abdi-rahman Musse. I live in Manchester which is a vibrant and
			multi-cultural place.	However, I was born in the Netherlands which I left at the age of 3.
			I had a very blessed and happy upbringing. I guess the only downside was that I
			was the only boy in my family, so I had no brothers to play with while growing up.
			On the plus side, I was very open and friendly,	so I was fortunate enough
			to have many friends my age who I spent a lot of time with while growing up.</p>

			<h3>What do I do&#58;</h3>
			<p>I am now a 20 year old computer science student at the <a href="http://www.salford.ac.uk">
			University of Salford.</a> Even though I have never done anything remotely related to
			computer science, I find it interesting and enjoyable. All my life, I have been studying
			biology, chemistry, and physics. However, I knew that science wasn't going
			to be the field	that I will be working in. Therefore, when it was time for me to
			choose a course for University, I decided to go with computer science which I have not regretted ever since.
			At times it might be difficult as this is all new to me, however, I believe
			that to enjoy what you are doing, you must give it your best effort.</p>

			<p>
				The modules that I am taking in my first year are:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Computer System Internals and Linux</li>
				<li>Database Systems</li>
				<li>professional Development and Practices</li>
				<li>Programming 1</li>
				<li>Programming 2</li>
				<li>Web Development and <abbr title="Human-Computer Interaction">HCI</abbr></li>
			</ol>

			<h3>My future plan&#58;</h3>
			<p>I am a huge believer in not stressing <em>too</em> much about the future and enjoying
			every day as it comes. However, that is not an excuse to simply sit back and don't do
			anything to further yourself in life. Here are some of my short and long-term goals.</p>
			<h4>Short-term goals&#58;</h4>
			<p>There are many things that I would like to do in the next few years.
			However, the three main tasks that I would like to accomplish are&#58;</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Graduating with a first class</li>
				<li>Being healthier by staying consistent in the gym and making better food choices</li>
				<li>Passing my driving test and getting a car</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Long-term goals&#58;</h4>
			<p>I usually try to not have more than three long term goals at any one time.
			This is because I have many short-term goals that assist in achieving my
			long-term goals. The three main long-term goals that I would like to accomplish are&#58;</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Being happy</li>
				<li>Being financially stable</li>
				<li>Being a more pious and righteous person</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Facts about me&#58;</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I am bilingual. I can speak English, Arabic and Somali</li>
				<li>I got a kitten called Hurayr which means cat in Arabic</li>
				<li>I am scared to death of dogs</li>
				<li>I love watching anime</li>
				<li>I look up to the greatest man in the world&#59; the Prophet Muhammad &#40;Peace be upon him&#41;</li>
			</ul>
